- isotonic position manipulation: in normal cases when we move over screen

- isotonic rate manipulation: this techinique could be used when we want to scroll up/down a long website or document. we just need to move the mouse a bit up/down, keep it there and the document/website will be automatically scolled.

- isotonic acceleration manipulation: when the document/website is way too long and we don't want the users to get bored.

- elastic position manipulation: 
	+ in shooting game like angry bird, this technique could be useful. 
	+ in driving simulation application, this technique could be used to simulate the effect of users pressing the brake.
	+ in the virtual world, when users pick up something, do something with it and then, want to return it to its original location

- elastic rate manipulation: in normal cases

- elastic acceleration manipulation:
	+ in racing games, this could be used to accelerate/speed up the vehicles
